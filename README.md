# brb-open-data

This repository contains codes for performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on data from [https://brb.bi/]  
and creating visualizations based on the cleaned data.

## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
The ETL process involves extracting data from an external source, cleaning and transforming it, and then loading it into a structured format for further analysis and visualization. In this repository, we have a Python script that performs the ETL process on a specific dataset:

- `etl_taux_inflation.py`

## Visualizations
Once the data has been processed and cleaned, we can create visualizations to gain insights and better understand the data. The repository contains Python scripts that creates various charts and plots based on the cleaned data:

- `visualization_taux_inflation.py`
- `visualization_taux_inflation_dashboard.py`
